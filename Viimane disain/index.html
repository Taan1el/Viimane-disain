        <p class="firstbigp">The story of Katniss Everdeen's first appearance at the Capitol Couture <br>offices is so
            famous, for a time it was a staple of every cocktail party <br>conversation in the Capitol. So it goes that
            Everdeen was scheduled to <br>be photographed for the cover of our third issue, Ignis Glace, a highly
            guarded <br>secret so as to prevent a riot amongst her adoring fans. However, due to a <br>communication
            error, Katniss walked right through our front doæors. The office <br>erupted in such deafening screams,
            (keep in mind those offices were <br>constructed out of molded titanium and glass) the front doors
            <br>completely shattered. Katniss, without skipping a beat, smiled and took a bow amongst the <br>shards of
            broken glass. That day, Katniss Everdeen was the most famous <br>woman in Panem. Today, speaking her name
            will get you killed. <br><br>Fully aware of the dire consequences this may have, Capitol Couture is bringing
            <br>you
            the feature no one else dares to: an in-depth look at the once beloved <br>Capitol icon who became the voice
            of a revolution and changed Panem forever.

                    <p>Y ou know her by many names: the Girl on Fire, the Mockingjay, Katniss <br>Everdeen. But before she was a
                        victor or a symbol for the rebellion,<br> she was a girl from 12. Her modest origins only make her story
                        more unlikely<br>, as stardom is so rarely attained by citizens of the outer districts. Take a look <br>at the
                        events and people that would come to define her.</p>

                    <p>Prim Everdeen couldn't have been more than ten years old when her name was called-but she was not taken
                        to the Capitol on day of the reaping. Katniss Everdeen's selfless gesture to volunteer made a lasting
                        impression on all of Panem. As she left to prepare for the gruesome battle ahead of her, she left behind
                        her entire life in 12.</p>

                    <p>The up-and-coming stylist, Cinna,
                        was made famous when he
                        designed a series of cutting edge
                        pieces for Katniss-including the
                        two looks covered in flames that
                        earned her the nickname, "The Girl

                    <p>The 75th Hunger Games proved to
                        be one of the most controversial in
                        modern times because of the
                        Games' epic climax when Katniss
                        and Peeta, threatened to eat
                        poison berries rather than be
                        without one another. Peeta and
                        Katniss's romantic saga would
                        continue to evolve and enchanted
                        Capitol citizens.</p>
